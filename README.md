# tradestatistics

The [tradestatistics](https://docs.ropensci.org/tradestatistics/index.html) package retrieves data on international trade from the [Open Trade Statistics](https://shiny.tradestatistics.io/countryprofiles/) project.

Open Trade Statistics (OTS) started as a visualization project back in 2017 as a [Shiny](https://comtradeplus.un.org/) interface to visualize data provided by the [UN Comtrade Database](https://comtradeplus.un.org/).

Please read this [blog post on rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/blog/2019/05/09/tradestatistics/) from 2019 to learn more about the implementation details of the API.

The package is available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tradestatistics/index.html).
